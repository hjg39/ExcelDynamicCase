Option A – Manual DLL drop (quickest)
Build the class-library project once in Visual Studio (Build ▸ Build GameContracts).
The DLL appears in bin\Release\netstandard2.0\GameContracts.dll.

Copy that DLL (and its GameContracts.pdb if you want step-through debugging) into your Unity project:
YourUnityProject/Assets/Plugins/.

Unity detects the new file, imports it, and you can immediately:

csharp
Copy
Edit
using GameContracts;   // in any Unity script
Whenever you make changes, rebuild the DLL and copy it over again.

Tip: If Unity shows “Assembly has reference to missing package XYZ”, copy any dependency DLLs the same way (e.g., System.Text.Json if you’re on a very old Unity build).
