Option A – Manual DLL drop (quickest)
Build the class-library project once in Visual Studio (Build ▸ Build GameContracts).
The DLL appears in bin\Release\netstandard2.0\GameContracts.dll.

Copy that DLL (and its GameContracts.pdb if you want step-through debugging) into your Unity project:
YourUnityProject/Assets/Plugins/.
